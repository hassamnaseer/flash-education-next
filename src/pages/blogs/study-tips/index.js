        <h2>Study Tips</h2>
        <br /><br />
        <div>
          I have seen students spend quality time reading and preparing for their exams. But, for one reason or the other, they still failed. It left me wondering – what could be responsible for that? I saw these students go into the library; some even woke up at night to ensure they were not behind the school syllabus. Nevertheless, all their effort was not good enough. With curiosity getting the best of me, I thought it was wise to probe deep into the matter.
          After many years of research and experimenting with several <strong>study tips</strong>, it dawned on me that it is not good enough to read. Rather, the secret to succeeding in every exam is doing the right thing at the right time. Are you eager to know how to score the highest in exams with great ease? Read the <strong>study tips</strong> below;
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Space Your Studies</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Many students never take their studies seriously until a week or some days before the exams. Such students usually adopt the approach of trying to cram everything just before the exam. They end up reading for long hours. Some have even had to go to exam halls without catching any sleep. Research has proven that this approach is bad for anybody. Avoid such study methods regardless. 
          According to one of the top psychologists at Williams College, our memory looks like a container with a small leakage point. If you keep trying to add water to such a container when it is still full, the container will not accommodate the new addition. However, when the water has drained out enough from the container, you can conveniently add more. That is how our brains work.
          Therefore, he recommends that you allow ample time between study sessions. Learn to rest after studying for a while. That will help to refresh your brain. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Practice As Much As Possible</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Musicians can come on stage and perform well because they practice a lot. The best athletes outperform their rivals because they put a lot of time and energy into their practice. The same applies to learning. 
          Katherine Rawson, a renowned psychologist, opines that having trouble recalling information is almost impossible with lots of practice. Various studies have been carried out to support this view. Students who spend much time practicing do better in exams when compared to their counterparts. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Re-reading Books & Notes Is Not Good Enough</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Among the many lousy <strong>study tips</strong>, this one is common among many students. There is this misconception that when you read things repeatedly, it starts to become a part of you. I am sorry to say that that is not the best approach. A group of university psychologists has found this approach insufficient for learning. 
          Do not just read the books. Make attempts to find out if you truly understand what is written there. Ask yourself some questions and see if you can answer them. Read in between the lines and see if you can make a more profound sense of the texts. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Test Yourself Before The Main Test</strong>
          <br /><br />
          This point is almost related to the one we just explained. However, I will explain more in this section. It isn't good for someone to walk into an exam or test hall without undertaking some form of quiz. 
          According to one learning expert, this is one of the most effective <strong>study tips</strong>. Get a set of flashcards and scribble questions at the back. Ask yourself those questions every time you go through those topics. If you have trouble answering any question, try to note the areas you are struggling with. 
          Revisit those areas when you are done with your small quiz. With more practice, you would soon gain mastery in those areas, and repeating your success on the exam day would be expected of you. 
          The point to note here is that when you engage in self-organized quizzes before your main test, it gives you a chance to learn your weak points and make up for those weaknesses. It is okay for you to generate questions outside the course content. That is because lecturers might ask questions beyond definitions, advantages & disadvantages, and the other obvious things in your course content. You do not have to leave any stones unturned if you want to score the highest. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>It’s Okay To Make Mistakes</strong>
          <br /><br />
          It is okay to make mistakes along the way as you prepare for your big test. Perhaps, you are unable to recall things as fast as you would have liked; please don't let that bother you. The aim is for you to make progress in your learning. It is not for you to become perfect. Simply put, progress, not perfection! 
          The most important thing is to ensure you learn from every mistake you make. If you continue in that manner, your chances of smashing your exams in flying colors will be high. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Look For Examples</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Some topics are abstract. Reading them alone may not help you the way you want. The best way is to look for something to help you understand them better. For instance, you may find it hard to grasp if you are told that sour foods contain acid. However, if you know how lemon or vinegar tastes, it will be easy to understand how acids taste because they all have the same sour taste. 
          The topic in question could be on electricity, telecoms, or IT. Look for examples that can explain the subject better. That way, such subjects will last longer in your memory. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Conclusion</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Have you been applying the wrong learning methods in the past? These <strong>study tips</strong> will assist in boosting your grades. The tips explained above will also make learning easier. There are also other factors one needs to consider in this regard. Get started with these tips, and be sure of getting the best out of your tests and exams.
