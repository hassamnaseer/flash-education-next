        <h2>How To Get Perfect Grade Point Average (4.0)</h2>
        <br /><br />
        <div>
          Many students never understand the essence of having good grades and a high GPA until they submit college admission applications. The students with the best GPAs get preferential treatment when applying for admission. It is assumed only the best students <strong>get 4.0</strong> and other high GPAs. 
          But, then, it is not enough to get a 4.0 GPA just because you need it to boost your application to Harvard. Finishing High School with a grade point average of 4.0 is a sign of hard work. There are several paths to achieving a 4.0 GPA. However, some methods are not as effective as I am about to show you. With the tips below, you can be sure of getting a high GPA, assuming you don't eventually make the 4.0 finish line. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Have The Right Mindset</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Your ability to <strong>get 4.0</strong> GPA starts from the mind. If you do not believe you are good enough, it will never happen regardless of how much time you spend reading. It’s like someone fighting a losing battle. Every time you try to do something, that little voice keeps telling you that you can’t do it. 
          <br /><br />
          Well, I have good news for you – anyone can finish High School with a high GPA. The first place to begin is to accept that you can improve and be motivated to pay the price. You will not be discouraged by minor setbacks when you develop that mindset. Here are a few things to help build the right attitude in you;
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
          <li>Have the growth mentality</li>
          <li>You are not created with a specific amount of intelligence</li>
          <li>Take responsibility for poor performances instead of blaming others</li>
          <li>It is possible to develop and train your intelligence</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Do Not Rule Out Hard Work</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Several polls have shown that one of the attributes common to 98% of students who <strong>get 4.0</strong> is hard work. By working hard, I mean you should be prepared to put in the hours to help you take care of those more challenging courses. 
          The best students don't shy away from the most challenging courses in their school, which usually come with AP or IB classes. Instead, they know they have to study hard and dedicate more hours to such courses. The brightest students dedicate between 2 to 5 hours every day, including weekends, to their assignments and studies. That's a lot of time. But, the best part is that if you aim to finish with a high GPA, you will get used to such study times with time. Giving between 2 and 5 hours of your time to become good at whatever you are doing is not that high a price, considering what you seek to achieve. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Discover What Motivates You</strong>
          <br /><br />
          If I say you will enjoy everything about your high school days, I will lie to you. Some of the days will be incredibly boring. That is because you would be exposed to unnecessary assignments, listen to unashamedly dull teachers, and you need to prepare for exams that are anything but fun. However, to make these moments enjoyable, you need to look for something that motivates you. 
          Motivation will make you grind out the best results even if you don't enjoy the course(s). Your inspiration can come from within or externally. The kind of motivation derived from your parents is extrinsic because it is externally sourced. This motivation is good because it may compel you to stop chatting with your friends at odd hours, and do your homework instead. Nevertheless, such motivation may eventually fail because it usually leads to resentment and frustration. 
          The motivation that comes from within is what will likely stand the test of time. Such paths are usually self-discovered. Therefore, when those tough times come, you can scale through all the hurdles because you have set a goal for yourself, and nothing will deter you from achieving that. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Plan Your Course Sequence Early</strong>
          <br /><br />
          High school is going to require four years of your time. So, it is only fair for you to know the classes you would be taking during that timeframe. Why is this important? It will help build you up mentally before the actual time. And when you have everything that is needed, you can proceed to get more information on those classes. 
          Enrolling in AP classes just for the fun of it is a no-no! That said, it is recommended that you only register for challenging courses that have a connection to your field of interest. According to Harvard admission officers, this is relevant and will boost your chances of admission into college. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Use Your Time Wisely</strong>
          <br /><br />
          This is the most crucial advice in this write-up. We are not the only humans struggling with time. Big shots like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos all struggle with time. The only thing that makes them unique is that they are wise with how they spend their time. 
          On a typical day, you have 8hours for school, 8hours for yourself outside school, and the last 8hours for sleeping. You may spend half of the 8hours you have for yourself to cater to homework and your extracurriculars. You don't have much time if you look at it critically. Therefore, it goes without mentioning that you spend the little time you have wisely. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Get Enough Rest</strong>
          <br /><br />
          I recommend that you work as hard as possible to achieve the best grades. But I'll be doing a great disservice if I told you to prioritize other things over sleep. Our brains are like machines. They are likely to break down when they work for too long and become overstressed. You must get enough rest whenever necessary. To <strong>get 4.0</strong>, you have to be consistent in your performance, and sleeping as at when due is the only way you can do that. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Conclusion</strong>
          <br /><br />
          A student that is determined to <strong>get 4.0</strong> must be patient and disciplined. Such students should know that the journey may be rough at times. The above tips are few, but they could help you get started on the right path.
