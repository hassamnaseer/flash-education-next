          Students are being introduced to extra-curricular activities and <strong>practicing sports</strong> in schools. Many students discover their passion for sports at a very young age in preliminary schools. The passion of such students get stronger with each passing day and they turn themselves into sports enthusiast. Watching sports and getting inspiration from athletes also ignites their energy to play sports they like. 
          Though there is nothing harmful in <strong>practicing sports</strong> (except the injuries of course), when students spend time on sports then it means that they are compromising the time spent on studies. It is quite difficult for students to multitask between their education and sports. They often find themselves so exhausted striving to score good grades and excelling in sports that they mostly fail in both. This is so because they fail to concentrate on both effectively and are unable to perform well in studies as well as sports. This is why students need to learn <strong>multitasking</strong> studying with sports. They need to create a balance between <strong>practicing sports</strong> and education to ensure that they excel in both fields.  
          Here are a few tactics that will help students in <strong>multitasking studying</strong> and <strong>practicing sports</strong>.
          <br /><br />

As a student, you should know your school timings, coaching timings, practice session timings, and other important issues. You should know how much time you need to study properly so that you don’t lag in class. After writing down these timings you can make sure that there exists no clash between <strong>practicing sports</strong> and study time. You can surely adjust timings to set up your schedule in a way that suits you. You cannot move school time so you can adjust in time to <strong>practicing sports</strong>. By managing your time effectively and efficiently you will be able to <strong>multitask studying</strong> and <strong>practicing sports</strong> comfortably. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Focus on good nutrition</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Good nutrition is essential for a healthy body and sound mind. Without nutritional intake, you won’t be able to perform well both mentally and physically. Mostly sports coaches guide the trainees about their food intake. If you get tips from your sports coach then do follow them. Or else you can ask some nutritionist for help or even better search online for healthy and nutritional food intake. Good nutrition will help you <strong>multitasking studying</strong> while <strong>practicing sports</strong> by keeping up your health and fitness level. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Focus on what requires urgent attention</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Multitasking studying</strong> with sports is not easy and sometimes you got need to make some circumstantial choices. For example, if you have a sports tournament then your mentor might want you to upscale <strong>practicing sports,</strong> which will surely consume more energy and time. This way you won’t be able to study properly. So, in this case, you need to acknowledge that your tournament needs urgent attention and have to compromise your study schedule a bit.
          Similarly in exams season, you need to cut down your practice to ensure that you are concentrating on your studies. Thus, focusing on what is more urgent will help you in <strong>multitasking studying,</strong> and <strong>practicing sports.</strong>

          <strong>Listen to lectures while working out for sports</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Nowadays the trend of E-learning has elevated like never before. If you have online lectures then you can listen to them while working out or warming up for sports for <strong>multitasking studies</strong>. For example, if you are on the treadmill or doing any such mild exercise where you know you can concentrate a bit on audio then you can use that time to listen to your lectures to grab the concepts deeply. This will surely aid you in <strong>practicing sports</strong> and <strong>multitasking studying</strong> at the same time. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Don’t procrastinate your studies</strong>
          <br /><br />
          The tip to <strong>multitasking studying</strong> is to ensure that you don’t delay your assignments. This is so because you can't afford to delay your studies as you will have to dedicate your time to <strong>practicing sports</strong> as well. If you procrastinate your studies then you will get overwhelmed near the deadline. This will not only disrupt your entire time plan for <strong>multitasking studying</strong> and <strong>practicing sports</strong> but will also make you exhausted and anxious and will affect your overall productivity. So, working by the schedule and completing study assignments on time is crucial to<strong> multitasking studying</strong> sports.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Minimize distractions</strong>
          <br /><br />
          This era is full of distractions. From social media notifications to chatty friends we are surrounded by many distractions to keep us off the track. It is quite crucial for students who wish to <strong>multitask studying</strong> with <strong>practicing sports</strong> to refrain from such distractions as they already had a lot on their plate. Letting distractions consume you while studying or <strong>practicing sports</strong> will affect your performance and waste your time. So it is essential to minimize distractions as much as you can to stay focused.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Utilize your weekends</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Well, weekends are meant for rest and addressing life chores. But if you wish to do the tough task of <strong>multitasking studying</strong> and <strong>practicing sports</strong> at the same time then you need to utilize your weekend efficiently. You can use your weekend to work on the task you are lagging on or which needs your concentration and time, be it studies or sports. For example, if you scored low on a test then you can study the same concept again on weekend to refine your concepts and ensure that you will score better next time. Or in another case if you missed your goal, say in (your sport) football, then you can spend some more time on weekend practicing on plenty stroke to master the sport.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Keep the stress away</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Multitasking studying</strong> and <strong>practicing sports</strong> is not an easy task to do. You might face failures at times which can cause you stress. Remember stress will further lower your productivity. So, just sit back, relax and embrace the failure with the attitude to win and strike back while pushing the stress away.
