        <br /><br />
        <div>
          Students have so many distractions these days that keep them occupied almost all the time. It is needed for the hour that they work on their study schedules and adopt certain habits and practices to regain the status of <strong>productive students</strong>. If you are a lousy student and you are worried to get good grades, then don’t worry because we got you covered. Despite all the distractions of social media, social life, and extracurricular activities, students can still boost their productivity by adopting these simple yet amazing <strong>study tips.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Devise a study schedule/ study plan</strong>
          <br /><br />
          A preliminary <strong>study tip</strong> to elevate your productivity is to devise a study plan in your busy routine. Life has become fast and it is difficult to get a grasp on time. This is why you must designate a particular time duration dedicated solely to studies. Especially if you are preparing for exams then it will be better if you take some time and develop a study schedule with the breakdown of all topics and concepts you want to cover in a day. This way you will get a sense of achievement on achieving a milestone. In case you miss your daily goal, still, then it will push you and boost up your enthusiasm to strictly follow the schedule to keep up the pace. Once you succeed in developing this habit of focusing on studies for a specific duration of time then nothing can stop you from being a <strong>productive student.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Devise a workable study plan</strong>
          <br /><br />
          The important <strong>study tip</strong> in devising an effective study plan is to be realistic in your approach. Set up a workable schedule and achievable milestones as per your potential and the time remaining to appear in exams. Realistic study goals will save you from the frustration of lagging behind the schedule. Productive students always keep in mind their studying capabilities, notes to be covered, exam due date, and other such factors while devising a study plan. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Attend your classes attentively</strong>
          <br /><br />
          The best <strong>study tip</strong> is to attend your classes and say no to bunks. Attending your classes might feel like an ordinary task and you must be thinking about how it will improve your productivity?
          Well, attending class is the first step to becoming a <strong>productive student</strong> only if you pay attention during the class. Attending the class absent-mindedly won’t do any good to you. Being present in class and paying attention to what the instructor says will help you understand the concepts and you can ask the instructor about any confusion. Reading it again at home will be easier if you had been vigilant during the class and this will surely enhance your productivity. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Don’t pile up homework</strong>
          <br /><br />
          No matter how good you are at your studies, if you keep on piling up your homework then you will lose your productivity. Students tend to get overwhelmed and stressed when they start their homework or assigned tasks right before the deadline due to the anxiety that they won’t be able to complete the task on submission time. This stress and anxiety kill their productivity and instead of coming up with an innovative and productive work they end up with an ordinary homework compilation. So, the best <strong>study tip</strong> for students who pile up the work is to start working on the assignment right after it is assigned. This way you will get the required time to come up with innovative and knowledgeable ideas and prove that you are a <strong>productive student</strong>. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Must take study breaks</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Some students get so indulged in their studies that they prefer to complete them in one sitting. Studying without study breaks kills productivity as the body and brain strive for rest. Draining all the energy will divert focus from the study material. This is why it is essential to take breaks while studying to become a <strong>productive student</strong>. Even many <strong>productive students</strong> don’t score well when they become too indulged in their studies to take a break. Such students must cut some slack and take necessary breaks to ensure that their brains and body have the energy to study and grasp the concepts. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Appropriate study environment</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Students must choose an appropriate environment to study in to turn into a <strong>productive students</strong>. Studying in a loud, distracting, and unpleasant environment will divert students’ attention and they won't be able to concentrate the way it is required. Lack of concentration will end up in poor grades no matter how much time students spend studying. We have come across many people who claim that they study hard but still are unable to get the desired result. Ever wonder why and how this happens? Let me tell you a great <strong>study tip</strong>, such people spend their time staring meaninglessly at their books while their concentration is on their environment say background music or background chat which occupies their brain and productivity. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Say no to social media and cell phones</strong>
          <br /><br />
          I agree that staying away from cell phones and social media seems like an impossible task. But it can take a break. To become a <strong>productive student</strong>, you have to put away your cell phones for study time to keep up your concentration. The biggest challenge arises in this regard because nowadays most of the notes and study material are present on cell phones, so what should we do then? Well, a simple study tip caters to this problem, don’t just tempt by social media while viewing notes on your cell phone. Because it will start with one notification and you will find ourself glued to that app for hours unintentionally and unconsciously. So, to avoid the temptation, just don’t open any social media applications or better turn off the internet (or Wi-Fi) while studying on the cell phone.  
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Group study with passionate and productive students</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Studying in the company of passionate and <strong>productive students</strong> is the best <strong>study tip</strong> to boost your enthusiasm and zeal for studies. The key is to control socializing with group members while studying.
