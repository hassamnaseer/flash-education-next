        <h2>Semantic memory and auditory component</h2>
        <br /><br />
        <div>
          When the conversation is about long-term memories, they are termed into two definitions; explicit memory and implicit memory. Explicit memory is also known as declarative memory. The class is further divided into <strong>Semantic Memory.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Semantic Memory</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Semantic memory</strong> is majorly aimed at factual knowledge of the world. In simpler terms, it is fair to say that it supports the interactions you have with the world using any sort of language (mostly, conceptual information). Not only this but general information also is a part of this memory. 
          <br /><br />
          For instance, while eating something, you recognize it by its origin and the knowledge you have of it, and how it is generally perceived. Not only this but introducing yourself with qualities that you have, especially the good ones, budgeting your monthly expenses by using maths, etc. all these activities fall into <strong>semantic memory.</strong> 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>What does research suggest about Semantic Memory?</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Various tests and other experiments have been made in order to know more about Semantic Memory’s origin and working. That being said, in 1981, a study was conducted in order to make more sense of this. Dallas and Jacoby made that possible with a bunch of students in college using them as their subject for the study. The purpose of the study was divided into two phases, mainly; episodic recognition and perceptual identification undertakings. Finally, the results of that experiment supported the performance-based differences between the episodic and semantic undertakings. 
          <br /><br />
          Furthermore, when the development of functional magnetic resonance comes into the picture, it is safe to say that it has promoted and opened many doors for this hypnosis. Other new developments clearly say that semantic memory consists of tons of functional systems. Not only this but it does not have any particular region yet that happens to have a role in representing the given knowledge.  
          <br /><br />
          In addition to this, neuroimaging studies say that semantic memory has a fair chance of being categorized into various sorts of visual information like size, color, and other forms. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Semantic Memory and its relation with auditory components</strong>
          <br /><br />
          The point of studying this aspect of memory in the first place is to investigate semantic information that stimulates auditory and visual-spatial memory and learning. The auditory task was tested where a group of healthy participants was placed right in the middle of a semicircle that had a set of speakers where the locations of recognizable and non-recognizable sounds were positioned. The particulates took part not only in auditory but visual-spatial segments as well and were found to have a balance for both of these aspects. The further results showed the memory and learning of recognizable pictures and sounds. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>How do we, as humans, make memories?</strong>
          <br /><br />
          The foundation of memories is torn down into the following categories. Please refer to the segment below:
          <br /><br />
          <li>Sensory memory: The on-the-spot things that we happen to encounter are mostly termed as sensory inputs and hence, get dropped into our short-term memories. Therefore, the formation of short-term memories stays there for half a minute without recognition. Hence, you happen not to remember more than seven bits of information at once.</li>
          <li>Long-term memory: Another one in the queue has to be long-term memory. This is known to be a major stage house of your brain where some memories tend to stay longer than expected. Long-term memory is calculated by using the ‘Working Memory principle which contains all the ways through which a profound cognition comes into existence through various auditory rehearsals. </li>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>The background and history of Semantic Memory</strong>
          <br /><br />
          The first instance of Semantic Memory was first recognized in 1972 by Endel Tulving and W Donaldson. They drew their inspiration from Reiff and Scheer to claim a differentiation between the types of memories we happen to have. 
          <br /><br />
          In the book, Episodic and Semantic Memory, the term is described and it’s verbal and words symbol and other relations between the different kinds of memories. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Semantic Memory and its Brain Regions</strong>
          <br /><br />
          The backstory of semantic memory's neuroscience has been subjective and a matter of debate. There have been many scientists who have made sense of its region but many questions and queries still persist. 
          <br /><br />
          Keeping this view in mind, the medial temporal lobes are known to be significant as they save most of the semantic memories. On the other hand, the hippocampal formation allows the memories to encode, and finally, the cortex saves all those encoded memories. 
          <br /><br />
          In addition to this, the given hypothesis brings light to the fact that hippocampal formation includes only a slight hint of hippocampal. However, the entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex constitute the parahippocampal cortices. When we come to terms with its support, the demonstration of semantic memory caused damage to their hippocampal, while the parahippocampal cortices had been limited in the same subject. 
          <br /><br />
          As far as the second group is concerned, it holds a memory of an animal like a dog that eventually stems from the visual as well as the auditory cortex. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Conclusion</strong>
          <br /><br />
          It is fair to say that there is some evidence that says semantic memory plays a vital role in spatial memory. The contrast has been made between both verbal as well as non-verbal. The intermixing of both of these aspects has replicated the study with two autonomous modalities. 
          <br /><br />
          Hence, the hypothesis study is still in function in order to create more sense of what else it is capable of. Plus the advantages that it consists of are yet namable and unnamable stimuli. These are still being examined in different sessions such as auditory and visual modalities.
