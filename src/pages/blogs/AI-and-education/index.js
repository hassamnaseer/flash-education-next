        <h2>AI And Education</h2>
        <br /><br />
        <div>
          As the years are going by, there seems to be a positive relationship or connection between artificial intelligence and <strong>education</strong>. This technology hasn’t just benefitted companies and other organizations in recent times. Rather, it has also improved education significantly. This is why experts are supporting the use of software and applications in schools far more than ever before. Again, the devastating effects of Covid-19 has made schools to start seeing reasons for its integration into their learning systems. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Is This A Good Sign?</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Although experts have managed to spot some challenges of <strong>AI</strong> adoption and integration into <strong>education</strong>, there is no doubting the fact that its benefits tend to outweigh these issues. In fact, there is every reason to believe that <strong>AI</strong> has taken education to another level entirely which most governments, scholars and educational experts could only dream of. 
          <br /><br />
          The truth is that adoption of artificial intelligence is the best thing that has ever happened to various categories of schools. Are you wondering how this has happened? There is no need entertaining such thoughts. This is because you are about to discover the various ways that artificial intelligence is positively influencing educational sectors around the world. Check them out below. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Personalized Learning</strong>
          <br /><br />
          It is no secret that personalization in <strong>education</strong> is very trendy at the moment. This wouldn’t have been possible without the emergence of <strong>AI</strong> technology. Gone are the days when students are being forced to adjust and learn at the same pace. In today’s world, students are allowed to learn based on their individual preferences and experiences. The best part about artificial intelligence is its ability to adapt to the individual knowledge, skill and ability of every student. 
          <br /><br />
          The benefit of this is that students are able to get the best learning experiences. Today, there are even applications that will present the performance history of different students. Also, there are tools (AI-powered) which students use for effective learning. Some of them even analyze their weaknesses and make the best possible recommendations. Personalizing of learning experiences just got much better than you have been thinking. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Possibilities For Tutoring</strong>
          <br /><br />
          The dream of every lecturer is that after teaching, all the students will acquire the necessary skills that can produce positive change in behavior. However, the reality is that such isn’t possible since some students will likely be left behind. In other words, they will not understand what has been taught. This is where artificial intelligence has contributed to education. 
          <br /><br />
          The students who have been left behind have the chance of contacting tutors online who can help them with lessons they find difficult and complicated. Today, there are lots of platforms where students can hire tutors of their choice on any topic or subject matter. With these professionals, they can learn easily and meet up with others in the classroom.   
          <br /><br />
          Today, there are companies rendering services which are being powered by <strong>AI</strong> bots. Without the help of a teacher, students can have the best of learning experiences.  
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Universal Access</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Few years back, students could travel to different countries around the world in a bid to acquire different learning skills and degrees. This tends to cost far more than imagined. In fact, there were students who claimed spending up to $100,000 during the course of study in other countries within a timeframe of 2-3years. Transportation cost is included in such cost. The implication of this is that if your budget is limited, you won’t get access to learning in these institutions. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>AI</strong> is beginning to change how schools conduct their learning sessions. For instance, there are online classes where students can take active part from any location around the world. It is all about having a computer and internet connection. There is no need thinking about how to get money for transportation. Since 2020 when the world got hit by Covid-19, there have been lots of emphases on online learning. This is to ensure that the problem of students coming in physical contact is reduced. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Smart Content Creation</strong>
          <br /><br />
          With artificial technology, the world is indeed a global village. It is now possible for people to carry out research on any topic or subject of their choice. With search engines like Google and Yahoo, you can get access to variety of information with click of few buttons. Today, students are finding it very easy to create any kind of content for their presentation in the most cost-effective way. These could be power point slides, videos, audios, Microsoft documents, and excel files. 
          <br /><br />
          With all of these, there has been an effective way through which their audiences can visualize information. The bottom line here is that <strong>AI</strong> has made it possible for scholars to get unrestricted access to information. A few years back when everything was manual in the educational sector, this wouldn’t have been possible. Based on the information available via artificial intelligence, it can be said that <strong>education</strong> has been digitized. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Automation of Tasks</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Things have really changed for good in the educational sector. This is because lots of platforms are committed towards providing real-time and accurate information. What used to take hours to complete now requires few minutes. For instance, a platform like Google helps in converting the currencies of countries accurately. There are applications that have been built to help students solve different mathematical problems that seem challenging. 
          <br /><br />
          The advent of artificial intelligence has made it easier for tasks to be automated. Today, you only need to click few buttons and data will be provided on any question or topic of your choice. This helps students that are carrying out research. For instance, there are applications that give marketing students insight about what people are searching on Google, Yahoo and Bing. With such data, they can easily come to objective conclusions in their studies. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Final Words</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Having seen all of the above, it can be said that there is a positive relationship between artificial intelligence and <strong>education</strong>. In other words, the former has an important role to play in making the latter better than it currently is.
